They wanted visual stand out and it had to work within the corporate guidelines created in Paris.\n\nThe Solution\n\nWe developed a ‘letterpress style’ that conveyed the feeling of established craftsmanship, and at the same time was distinctive. It had the legs to work across all marketing materials in both print & digital.\n\nThe Results\n\nThe campaign was striking and memorable; the sales team got good feedback and the CTR the online campaign achieved suggests it is created quite an impact, not to mention inflows into the funds.\n\n![](/static/uploads/axa_short_duration_fullpg_sept14_v4-1.png)\n\n![](/static/uploads/axa_globe.png)\n\n![](/static/uploads/axa_master_uk_disp_fund_fullpg_july14.png)",
