Each advertisement featured a different collection from Theoâ€™s range to demonstrate the breadth of his designs.\n\n## The Results\n\nThe campaign raised awareness, created favourable press coverage in relevant financial and fashion publications and increased sales of the jewellery featured in the advertisements.",
