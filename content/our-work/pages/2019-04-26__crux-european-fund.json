  "body": "# Crux Asset Management\n\nSpecial Situations Fund\n\n## The Task\n\nHaving created CRUXâ€™s brand identity and launched them into the market with a corporate advertising campaign, they asked us to develop a B to C campaign sharing the strong performance of their funds.\n\n## The Solution\n\nWe developed a campaign using close up shots of classic performance cars, creating the analogy between these beautifully constructed high performance machines and their funds.\n\n## The Results\n\nThe campaign has taken the fund from an average position of 43/108 funds in their sector, in terms of net sales, to 2/107 - and quickly too.\n\n<Player url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNpk5HeSTg\" />\n\n<Player url=\"https://youtu.be/5X6FMO0aawc\" />",
