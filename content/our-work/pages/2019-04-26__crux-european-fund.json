  "body": "# Crux Asset Management _European Specialist Situations Fund_\n\n## The Task\n\nHaving created CRUXâ€™s brand identity and launched them into the market with a corporate advertising campaign, they asked us to develop a B to C campaign sharing the strong performance of their European Special Situation Fund.\n\n## The Solution\n\nWe developed a campaign using close up shots of classic performance cars, creating the analogy between these beautifully constructed high performance machines and their funds.\n\n## The Results\n\nThe campaign has taken the fund from an average position of 43/108 funds in their sector, in terms of net sales, to 2/107 - and quickly too.\n\n<Player url=\"https://vimeo.com/337978403\" />\n\n<Player url=\"https://vimeo.com/337978416\" />\n\n<Player url=\"https://vimeo.com/38838178\" />",
