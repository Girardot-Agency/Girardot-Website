They also wanted an advertising campaign to launch the brand as Woodham Mortimer.\r\n\n## The solution\n\nWe re-named the brand after a village in the local area, so the name had relevance.  We then created a simple but smart logo combined with a descriptor of their services.  The advertising campaign promoted their offering with highly sophisticated photography to give real stand out.\r\n\n## The results\n\nThe look and feel of the logo and advertising has transformed the brand which is now seen as one of the most professional and sophisticated in the sector",
