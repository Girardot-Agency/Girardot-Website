They also wanted an advertising campaign to launch the brand as Woodham Mortimer.\n\n## The Solution\n\nWe re-named the brand after a village in the local area, so the name had relevance.  We then created a simple but smart logo combined with a descriptor of their services.  The advertising campaign promoted their offering with highly sophisticated photography to give real stand out.\n\n## The Results\n\nThe look and feel of the logo and advertising has transformed the brand which is now seen as one of the most professional and sophisticated in the sector\n\n<Player url=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/333345173\" />\n\n<Player url=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/333345165\" />",
