  "body": "# Premier Asset Management\n\nOptimum Income\n\n## The Task\n\nPremier Asset Management asked us to build their brand awareness, pretty much from scratch. At the same time they wanted us to promote their funds and increase inflows. \n\n## The Solution\n\nWe used Premier's strong colours to increase brand recognition. We also included performance figures and tables in the advertisements to show the strength of the featured funds.  \n\n## The Results\n\nIn a recent survey of 30 asset management companies carried out by Bdifferent, Premier was one of the top two companies whose brand awareness had grown the fastest. Also, funds under management have increased significantly in the funds featured in the advertising.\n\n<Player url=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/333301644\" />",
