They introduced their first tracker fund in 1988.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nWe created a campaign using ‘slot racing’ imagery styled in the HSBC colours. The analogy links the values in F1 with investment - dynamic, innovative, leading edge, fast moving and focused.\n\n**The Results**\n\nThe online campaign delivered well above average click through rates and inflows into the funds increased. It also raised awareness of HSBC's leading position as a provider of passive investments..\n\n<Player url=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/325662373\" />",
