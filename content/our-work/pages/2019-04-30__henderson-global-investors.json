The concept was extremely adaptable and was taken across print, online, outdoor and literature and was used internally as well as externally.\n\n**The Results**\n\nThe advertising was much talked about  and in research was seen by over three quarters of advisors as the campaign with the most impact in its sector (Bdifferent research). It raised awareness of the brand by 73% in 3 months (Ptarmigan survey.)",
