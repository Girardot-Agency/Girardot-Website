One lifestyle campaign and one specialist financial campaign. \n\n**The Solution** \n\nThe lifestyle campaign was running in publications like The Field and Country Life, so we styled the advertising to match the target audience. The other campaign was running in B to C financial publications so it was styled accordingly. \n\n**The Result**\n\nThe lifestyle campaign and the specialist financial campaign had great stand out and achieved higher than average CTRs. \n\n<Player url=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/333335273\" />\n\n<Player url=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/333335264\" />",
