Together we took Jupiter’s retail funds under management from £200 million to over £5 billion.\"\n\n\"Girardot’s track record for developing simple and effective creative ideas made them a natural choice when it came to us selecting an agency to help us launch CRUX Asset Management.\"\n\n\"We are delighted with the campaign they have created for us and are confident it will deliver the results we are looking for.\"",
